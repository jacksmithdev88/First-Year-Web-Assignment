        <H2>What I would like to learn</H2>
        <p>In my degree I would like to learn about a variety of things. First of all I would like to expand my general knowledge of computer systems. This would be good for me as I have had a general interest in computers ever since I can remember.</p>

        <h2>Expanding my knowledge</h2> 
        <p>I would also like to expand my knowledge in various different programming languages. I already know a few. These are: Python, C#, HTML, CSS and some others. I would to build up on some of the foundations that I have obtained in these languages.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Finally, I would also like to use some of the knowledge that I am gaining to put towards some of my hobbies. For example, I actively like coding in my spare time so learning a new programming language at university would allow me to further this hobby.</p>
