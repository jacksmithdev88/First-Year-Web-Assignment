# First-Year-Web-Assignment
This is a basic website, composed of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The premise of this website is to show my basic understanding of these languages.

It was a part of my first year Web Development module at Staffordshire University.

The key components that I learnt from this project are: 
<br>
  -Hosting a website through Firebase.
  -Basic CSS styling, implementing shared and individual styles to components.
  -JavaScript functionality, creating a coffee ordering page using only JavaScript.
  -HTML Structure, creating a website base using HTML.
  -Correct manifest for a website, generating FavIcon's and serviceworkers for a website.
